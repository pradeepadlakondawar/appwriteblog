An advanced web application designed to offer a rich blogging platform with state-of-the-art text editing and content management features. This project leverages cutting-edge web technologies to deliver an intuitive and dynamic user experience, enabling users to create, edit, and publish content seamlessly.

## Key Contributions

- **Interactive Text Editor:** Implemented an interactive text editor using [`@tinymce/tinymce-react`](package.json#L14) for a rich content creation experience.

- **Robust Routing:** Developed robust routing mechanisms with React Router ([`react-router-dom`](package.json#L21)) to support seamless navigation within the app.
  
- **Backend Services:** Leveraged AppWrite ([`appwrite`](package.json#L15)) for backend services, facilitating user authentication, database management, and server-side operations.
  
- **Development Tools:** Employed modern development tools and practices, including ESLint ([`eslint`](package.json#L28)) for code quality and Vite ([`vite`](package.json#L34)) for an optimized build process.
  
- **Styling:** Styled the application using Tailwind CSS ([`tailwindcss`](package.json#L33)), enabling responsive and visually appealing interfaces.
